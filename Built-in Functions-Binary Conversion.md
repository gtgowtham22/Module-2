# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```

## Output
![438109262-8f430ebe-a612-44ae-9e21-d057296ee0c5 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f92d1e8-bd72-49ff-81fd-64a6118ea601)

## Result
The number 16 was successfully converted into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.
